BBOalert, file must begin with BBOalert keyword

Empty lines are allowed for better readability
Comment lines like this are ignored

The opening bid must begin with empty field
,1C,17+HCP any distribution,Comment: this is the typical opening bid of Precision System

You should ignore eventual passes preceding the opening bid
--1C,17+HCP any distribution, this will not work

The negative response to 1C opening is 1D
1C--,1D,0-7HCP any distribution
The bidding context is 1C-- which means opening 1C followed by opponent's pass (-- code)

Opener's rebid after 1D response will be coded
1C--1D--,1N,17-19HCP balanced hand

Similar after the 1H overcall after 1D
1C--1D1H,1N,17-19HCP balanced hand

Our own overcalls after opponent's opening are represented by code
1H,2N,minor two-suiter

For better readability leading spaces or tabs are allowed
1H,     2N,     minor two-suiter

If the same bidding sequence is defined twice, only the last one will be considered.
Typical situation when, during the game, you modify the exeplanation for the alerted call.
Any modification made during the game will appear in the clipboard (paste at the end of the existing table).
In the comment field you will find the time stamp and the deal number for eventual review.
