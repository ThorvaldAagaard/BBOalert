1. File format

Valid records should contain at least 3 fields seperated by comma
<context>,<call>,<explanation>,<comment>
where <context> represents the bidding before <call>. <explanation> is the text to accompany tha alerted call.
<comment> field is optional. Spaces or tabs are allowed at the beginning or end of each field for better readability.

Empty lines are allowed for better readability
Comment lines like this are ignored

Example :
1C--1D--1H--,	1N,		explanation text, 

Note -- which represents passed oponents. Instead of -- you can use double underscore __ as wild card if the meaning of the call
does not depend of eventual overcalls made by oponents.
In the example below, the meaning of each of each call remains the same, even if oponents bid.
1C__1D__1H__,	1N,		explanation text,

The opening bid must begin with empty field
,1C,17+HCP any distribution,Comment: this is the typical opening bid of Precision System

The negative response to 1C opening is 1D
1C--,1D,0-7HCP any distribution
The bidding context is 1C-- which means opening 1C followed by opponent's pass (-- code)

Opener's rebid after 1D response will be coded
1C--1D--,1N,17-19HCP balanced hand

Similar after the 1H overcall after 1D
1C--1D1H,1N,17-19HCP balanced hand

If the opening is seat sensitive you should mention explicitely initial passes
----,1H,9-14HCP 4+!S
----1S--,2C,10-11p Drury after initial pass

Our own overcalls after opponent's opening are represented by code
1H,2N,minor two-suiter

For better readability leading spaces or tabs are allowed
1H,     2N,     minor two-suiter

If the same bidding sequence is defined twice, only the last one will be considered.
Typical situation when, during the game, you modify the exeplanation for the alerted call.
Any modification made during the game will appear in the clipboard (paste at the end of the existing table).
In the comment field you will find the time stamp and the deal number for eventual review.

If the explanation text excceds 39 characters, you can use # character to split it in to parts.
The first will appear in the explanation field of the bidding box, the second part in the chat box.
You should send the chat message to the opponents manually. Example :
,1D,Short explanation text#Long chat message text limited to 249 characters

Keyboard abbreviations can be defined :
Shortcut,   TC,   Texas !C
Shortcut,   TD,   Texas !D
Shortcut,   TH,   Texas !H
Shortcut,   TS,   Texas !S
Shortcut,   GTG,  Sorry but I have to leave. I enjoyed the game
