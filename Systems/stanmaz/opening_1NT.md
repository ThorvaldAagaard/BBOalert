<b>Case 4 : if responder has a problematic hand with shortness in a major</b>

- Shortness in a major suit is a potential vulnerability when the openers has no double stopper. In such a case a game contract with 4-3 major fit should be considered. The responder shows a short major by bidding it at level 3. Typical sequences are :

		1N__,		3H,	4441 short !H
		+,			3S,	4441 short !S
		1N__2C__2D__,	3H,	5!D4!S game forcing short !H
		+,				3S,	5!D4!H game forcing short !S
		+,				3H,	5!C4!S game forcing short !H
		+,				3S,	5!C4!H game forcing short !S

- If the responder has no 4 card major game contract in a minor should be considered:

		1N__,		3D,	5!C5!D game forcing

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<b>Case 5 : if responder has slam values :</b>

- He should always begin with the inquiry of opener’s force

		1N__2C__2D__,	2S,	asking opener’s force
		1N__2C__2D__2S__,	2N,	minimum
		+,			3C,	maximum short in !C
		+,			3D,	maximum short in !D
		+,			3H,	maximum short in !H
		+,			3S,	maximum short in !S
		+,			3N,	maximum 4333
