	1N__,		2S,	5+!C at least game inviting
	1N__,		2N,	Transfer -> 3!C. may be weak

<b>Case 1 : if responder is weak, he can :</b>

- pass 1NT
- use transfer and pass
- use 1NT-2C-2D transfert and bid 2H with weak major two-suiter

		1N__2C__,	2D,	mandatory
		1N__2C__2D__,		2H,	weak 5!H5!S

- bid 3C with weak two-suiter at least 4-4

		1N__,	3C,	weak 4+!C4+!D

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<b>Case 2 : if responder has only invitational values he can :</b>

- ask opener’s force using 1NT-2C-2D transfert without 5 card suit

		1N__2C__2D__,	2S,	11+p asking opener’s force,		see Case 5

- Bid his 5+ card Hearts using transfer and then :

		1N__2D__2H__,	2S,	5!H5!S game inviting

		1N__2S__2N__,	3C,	6!C game inviting

<b>Case 3 : if responder has a trivial hand with 5+M and GF values :</b>

		1N__4D__,		4H,	Sign-off
		1N__,		4H,	Transfer->4!S
		1N__4H__,		4S,	Sign-off


<b>Case 4 : if responder has a problematic hand with shortness in a major</b>

- Shortness in a major suit is a potential vulnerability when the openers has no double stopper. In such a case a game contract with 4-3 major fit should be considered. The responder shows a short major by bidding it at level 3. Typical sequences are :

		1N__,		3H,	4441 short !H
		+,			3S,	4441 short !S
		1N__2C__2D__,	3H,	5!D4!S game forcing short !H
		+,				3S,	5!D4!H game forcing short !S
		+,				3H,	5!C4!S game forcing short !H
		+,				3S,	5!C4!H game forcing short !S

- If the responder has no 4 card major game contract in a minor should be considered:

		1N__,		3D,	5!C5!D game forcing

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<b>Case 5 : if responder has slam values :</b>

- He should always begin with the inquiry of opener’s force

		1N__2C__2D__,	2S,	asking opener’s force
		1N__2C__2D__2S__,	2N,	minimum
