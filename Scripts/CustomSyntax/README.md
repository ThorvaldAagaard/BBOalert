The <call> field can be defined dynamically using a script. Example :

    Script,raise,R = Râ€€= getBidFromContext(2,0,5);

In this example the the arguments of bidSymbol are :
- "raise" = arbitrary name
- getBidFromContext function computing the call field content dynamically. The arguments are :
    - 2 = partner (0=caller;1=LHO;2=partner;3=RHO)
    - 0 = partner's first bid (opening bid)
    - 5 = fifth bid above the opening which is the raise call (e.g. after opening 1H the raise of 2H is the fifth step)
 
The BBOalert code example :

    ,1[HS],5 cards suit
    1[HS]--,%raise%,8-10p 3+ cards fit
    1[HS]--%raise%--,2N,trial bid; no shortness

To make the code more readable we can substitute the %raise% script call by an alias of your choice. By default the alias is used in all fields. To avoid the unpredictable effects we can limit its usage to the context and to the call field by @C@B tags. Also the script and alias names must be different.

    Alias,RAISE,%raise%,@C@B
    ,1[HS],5 cards suit
    1[HS]--,RAISE,8-10p 3+ cards fit
    1[HS]--RAISE--,2N,trial bid; no shortness

Finally we can improve the code by using the buletted lists (see BBOalert README file) :

    Alias,RAISE,%raise%,@C@B
    ,1[HS],5 cards suit
    - RAISE     8-10p 3+ cards fit
        - 2N         trial bid; no shortness
